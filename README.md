# Picture in Picture Project

## Introduction

This web project allows users to watch any video in picture-in-picture mode. Picture-in-picture mode is a feature that lets users display a video element in a floating window that stays on top of other windows or applications. This way, users can watch their favorite videos while multitasking on their computer.

## How it works

This web project uses the [Picture-in-Picture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API) to request and exit picture-in-picture mode for a video element. It also uses the [Screen Capture API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API) to let users select any video source from their screen, such as a browser tab, an application window, or their entire desktop.
